    <title lang="en">Inception</title>
    <desc lang="en">Your mind is the scene of the crime. Box-office superstar Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this contemporary science fiction action film set "within the architecture of the mind." Written, directed and produced by Oscar and Golden Globe nominee Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, The Prestige), this eagerly awaited follow-up to 2008's billion-dollar blockbuster is yet another visionary tale from a startingly original filmmaker who continually raises the bar with every film he makes. Shooting in London, Paris, Tangiers, Calgary and Los Angeles, Nolan's mind-bending film also stars Academy Award winners Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard, in addition to Juno's Ellen Page, Batman Begins' Cillian Murphy and Oscar nominees Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) and Tom Berenger (Platoon).</desc>
