Back in Greendale the villagers are only too delighted to take all of Ted's weird and wonderful inventions off his hands but the more inventions that go, the more gloomy Ted gets. After a trip over a very bumpy field and flight in the plane, Pat finally delivers the engine to a now very sad Ted. He's depressed because he loves to tinkering with things, and now he has nothing left to tinker with. Maybe the engine will cheer him up but when Pat takes the side off the crate, just a heap of engine parts spill out. The engine was shaken apart on the journey. Pat is very sorry but Ted is delighted. Now he has something to tinker with again! Mission accomplished!</desc>

Pat and Jess meet the eccentric Ned Glenn at his workshop and wrestle with the crate containing the heavy engine to get it aboard the plane. Back in Greendale the villagers are only too delighted to take all of Ted's weird and wonderful inventions off his hands but the more inventions that go, the more gloomy Ted gets. After a trip over a very bumpy field and flight in the plane, Pat finally delivers the engine to a now very sad Ted. He's depressed because he loves to tinkering with things, and now he has nothing left to tinker with. Maybe the engine will cheer him up but when Pat takes the side off the crate, just a heap of engine parts spill out. The engine was shaken apart on the journey. Pat is very sorry but Ted is delighted. Now he has something to tinker with again! Mission accomplished!</desc>

Overwhelmed by her efforts to help her mom and NaiNai in the shop, Yi asks the toad to spit up helpful items – but Jin and Peng aren’t so selfless. As a result of granting an abundance of wishes for the whole crew, the toad becomes too weak to continue. Realizing the error of their ways and why the toad appeared in the first place, Yi and Everest use their magic to reverse the toad’s magic onto himself so he can wish himself home.</desc>
