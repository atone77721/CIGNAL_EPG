    <title lang="en">Postman Pat: Special Delivery Service</title>
    <desc lang="en">Julian and the kids at Greendale School are excited about a Festival of flight - Ted's coming to talk about aviation and Alf's bringing Cedric the racing pigeon. Pat has to deliver special jet boots to the school, built by Ted's inventor friend. Ted will demonstrate them. But on the way to Greendale, Pat stops to help Alf, whose cows have got loose. Pat sees Ajay, out for a day's bird-watching. Pat has promised to lend Ajay his wellies and asks Ajay to get them from the van, but Ajay takes the jet boots by mistake. By the time Pat realises the mixup, Ajay is airborne and can't control the powerful boots... Meanwhile Alf and Ted grow competitive as they try to win the kids' attention. Attempts to shout instructions to Ajay fail, but Pat realises Cedric could be the solution. The brave bird takes an instruction leaflet up to Ajay - who is then able to control the boots (using his toes) with ease! Meera, Julian and the others are delighted as Ajay touches down at Greendale School with the help of Cedric - the most welcome bird Ajay has ever watched!</desc>

Forced to put aside longstanding hostilities, the two team up on a joint mission to stop a mysterious international criminal organization, which is bent on destabilizing the fragile balance of power through the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology. The duo's only lead is the daughter of a vanished German scientist, who is the key to infiltrating the criminal organization, and they must race against time to find him and prevent a worldwide catastrophe.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A weekly talk-show looking beyond the headlines and “accepted wisdom” to find the real story. Hosted by award-winning journalist and presenter Stephen Cole, The Agenda  quite simply sets The Agenda . You won’t find the same-old talking heads recycling platitudes; instead thought-provoking guests to debate and explore key issues of today’s world. Using virtual reality graphics to bring subjects to life, Stephen will navigate through subjects ranging from “Prove That Climate Change Exists”  to “Who Will Win the Race to Space”. Opposing views will be given opportunity to flourish and develop into a meaningful conversation. 
The Agenda: No nonsense talk; Challenging perceptions.
