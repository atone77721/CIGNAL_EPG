    <desc lang="en">An overworked and under loved Precious has to choose between the Templeton Family startup business or Crispin Biscuits’ fun playtime. Meanwhile, the company makes its first purchase: upgraded communicators! R &amp; D Baby Simmons is reluctant to fix the model they have, which picks up signals from her favorite lvorian soap opera, “Bridges Aflame.” Over a live broadcast, Simmons must convince the cast to tie up every loose plot thread before she has to lose the signal forever.</desc>

Tina gets jealous of Carol doting on Lil Bit, while Benji reveals that in order to make his daughter proud of him, he’s applied to become a Federal Agent. With Boss Baby’s cover at stake, it’s up to the Templeton Family to get Benji out of their hair as he sniffs around for a case that could garner the attention from federal law enforcement.</desc>
