The clowning goes too far when someone sets up a bucket of balls joke that almost causes an accident. Noddy needs to investigate to find out who is the unfunny clown before a ‘joke' goes too far.  Using all his detecting skills and reconsidering evidence, Noddy works out that the unfunny clown is actually Fuse! He didn't realise that the clowning jokes he was playing on the other toys weren't actually funny! Noddy shows Fuse a way in which he can join in with the clowning in a safe way and Clown Day can go ahead after all.  Well done Noddy! Case closed!</desc>
