A dried up jellyfish-type creature has been discovered at a construction site, and the anti-creature contractor wants it GONE. The crew try taking Jelleen to the sewers to live with Sewer Koi, but the unhappy creature creates a blackout in the sewers with its magical electric charge. Realizing that Jelleen should be able to stay in her original home, the crew must stand up against the contractor and force her to see the error of her ways… or else!</desc>

From the creative storytelling ("4x4") to the macabre ("Who Shot Sherlock?"), there’s something in Season 5 for everyone. The CSI team investigates many crimes that hit close to home as well. Grissom comes under fire from Ecklie ("Mea Culpa"), Brass tracks down his estranged daughter ("Hollywood Brass"), and during the course of the season Greg Sanders completes his transition from the lab to the field. Last, but not least, Season 5 wraps with an amazing two-part episode ("Grave Danger"), written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, where Nick comes face to face with death while the team exhausts all its resources to same him.</desc>
