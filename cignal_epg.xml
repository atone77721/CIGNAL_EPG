    <desc lang="en">A weekly talk-show looking beyond the headlines and “accepted wisdom” to find the real story. Hosted by award-winning journalist and presenter Stephen Cole, The Agenda  quite simply sets The Agenda . You won’t find the same-old talking heads recycling platitudes; instead thought-provoking guests to debate and explore key issues of today’s world. Using virtual reality graphics to bring subjects to life, Stephen will navigate through subjects ranging from “Prove That Climate Change Exists”  to “Who Will Win the Race to Space”. Opposing views will be given opportunity to flourish and develop into a meaningful conversation. 
The Agenda: No nonsense talk; Challenging perceptions.
