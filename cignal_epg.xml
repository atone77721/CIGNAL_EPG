    <desc lang="en">The Naughticorns have borrowed Noddy's music player to practise a special dance for Pat-Pat's Pumpkin Party. But when Noddy arrives at the party, the other toys are all scared by a strange noise. Noddy decides to investigate: what's making the scary noise? Using his investigating skills and following all the clues, Noddy arrives at the Naughticorn Stables where he realises that the scary noise is actually a slowed down tune on the music player.  The Naughticorns have played it so much that the battery is running out.   The Naughticorns have been taking the music player all around Toyland, desperately trying to fix or hide. Noddy reassures them it's not broken, it just needs new batteries in. The Naughticorns say sorry for scaring everyone and Pat-Pat's Pumpkin Party can at last get under way.  Well done Noddy!</desc>

Born of a god, but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from the clutches of Hades (Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes -- Harry Potter films), the vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, he volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus (Oscar nominee Liam Neeson -- Batman Begins) and unleash hell on earth. With a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will triumph only if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.</desc>

You won’t find the same-old talking heads recycling platitudes; instead thought-provoking guests to debate and explore key issues of today’s world. Using virtual reality graphics to bring subjects to life, Stephen will navigate through subjects ranging from “Prove That Climate Change Exists”  to “Who Will Win the Race to Space”. Opposing views will be given opportunity to flourish and develop into a meaningful conversation. 
The Agenda: No nonsense talk; Challenging perceptions.
