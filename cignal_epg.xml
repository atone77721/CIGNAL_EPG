Despite this, the ice starts to melt on the way to the Schoolhouse.  PC Selby is getting concerned by the overflowing recycling and deems it a traffic hazard.  Ted and Alf help collect the recycling early but some of the plastic bottles spill onto the road, causing a road jam that blocks Pat.  By the time he gets the blocks to the schoolhouse there is nothing left but tiny ice cubes.  The children are disappointed but Pat remembers thinking the plastic bottles in the road earlier were ice.  He and Ted unload the recycling and Lauren and the children use the plastic bottles to make a much warmer igloo instead.  Mission accomplished!</desc>

Forced to put aside longstanding hostilities, the two team up on a joint mission to stop a mysterious international criminal organization, which is bent on destabilizing the fragile balance of power through the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology. The duo's only lead is the daughter of a vanished German scientist, who is the key to infiltrating the criminal organization, and they must race against time to find him and prevent a worldwide catastrophe.</desc>
