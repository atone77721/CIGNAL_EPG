Meanwhile, the weather is getting worse out at Pencaster Lighthouse and Chris realises, sadly, that he'll have to stay and man the lighthouse and make sure that the passing boats are protected. He won't be able to join everyone for his birthday after all! But Pat has a great idea – if Chris can't come to the birthday party, the birthday party can come to him! With the help of the SDS helicopter Pat delivers all of Chris's birthday presents directly to him at the lighthouse! Everyone contacts Chris by video conference so that even if they can't be there, he's not alone on his birthday! Special delivery service – mission accomplished!</desc>

Meanwhile, the weather is getting worse out at Pencaster Lighthouse and Chris realises, sadly, that he'll have to stay and man the lighthouse and make sure that the passing boats are protected. He won't be able to join everyone for his birthday after all! But Pat has a great idea – if Chris can't come to the birthday party, the birthday party can come to him! With the help of the SDS helicopter Pat delivers all of Chris's birthday presents directly to him at the lighthouse! Everyone contacts Chris by video conference so that even if they can't be there, he's not alone on his birthday! Special delivery service – mission accomplished!</desc>

    <title lang="en">CSI S4 E02 - All For Our Country</title>
    <desc lang="en">Season 4 begins with terrific back-to-back episodes involving serial killers ("Assume Nothing" / "For All Our Country"). There's a new politically minded sheriff in town and in "Invisible Evidence" he's ticked off that the CSI's can't get enough evidence to convict a rapist/murderer. Also, Nick and Sara buck for the same promotion. Along the way there are plenty of quirky cases: one involving a museum robbery ("Suckers") and one involving a dead juror ("Eleven Angry Jurors").

    <desc lang="en">A weekly talk-show looking beyond the headlines and “accepted wisdom” to find the real story. Hosted by award-winning journalist and presenter Stephen Cole, The Agenda  quite simply sets The Agenda . You won’t find the same-old talking heads recycling platitudes; instead thought-provoking guests to debate and explore key issues of today’s world. Using virtual reality graphics to bring subjects to life, Stephen will navigate through subjects ranging from “Prove That Climate Change Exists”  to “Who Will Win the Race to Space”. Opposing views will be given opportunity to flourish and develop into a meaningful conversation. 
The Agenda: No nonsense talk; Challenging perceptions.
