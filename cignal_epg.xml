    <desc lang="en">Your mind is the scene of the crime. Box-office superstar Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this contemporary science fiction action film set "within the architecture of the mind." Written, directed and produced by Oscar and Golden Globe nominee Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, The Prestige), this eagerly awaited follow-up to 2008's billion-dollar blockbuster is yet another visionary tale from a startingly original filmmaker who continually raises the bar with every film he makes. Shooting in London, Paris, Tangiers, Calgary and Los Angeles, Nolan's mind-bending film also stars Academy Award winners Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard, in addition to Juno's Ellen Page, Batman Begins' Cillian Murphy and Oscar nominees Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) and Tom Berenger (Platoon).</desc>

Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation, Avatar) stars as the Greek hero Perseus in this spectacular retelling of the classic myth (and '80s cult classic film). Born of a god, but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from the clutches of Hades (Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes -- Harry Potter films), the vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, he volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus (Oscar nominee Liam Neeson -- Batman Begins) and unleash hell on earth. With a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will triumph only if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.</desc>
