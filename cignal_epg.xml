    <title lang="en">CSI S5 E17 - Compulsion</title>
    <desc lang="en">Some provocative episodes from Season 5 of CSI involve Russian mail order brides ("Nesting Dolls"), infantism ("King Baby"), and the Mexican lifestyle of narcocorrido ("Snakes"). From the creative storytelling ("4x4") to the macabre ("Who Shot Sherlock?"), there’s something in Season 5 for everyone. The CSI team investigates many crimes that hit close to home as well. Grissom comes under fire from Ecklie ("Mea Culpa"), Brass tracks down his estranged daughter ("Hollywood Brass"), and during the course of the season Greg Sanders completes his transition from the lab to the field. Last, but not least, Season 5 wraps with an amazing two-part episode ("Grave Danger"), written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, where Nick comes face to face with death while the team exhausts all its resources to same him.</desc>

    <title lang="en">Inception</title>
    <desc lang="en">Your mind is the scene of the crime. Box-office superstar Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this contemporary science fiction action film set "within the architecture of the mind." Written, directed and produced by Oscar and Golden Globe nominee Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, The Prestige), this eagerly awaited follow-up to 2008's billion-dollar blockbuster is yet another visionary tale from a startingly original filmmaker who continually raises the bar with every film he makes. Shooting in London, Paris, Tangiers, Calgary and Los Angeles, Nolan's mind-bending film also stars Academy Award winners Michael Caine and Marion Cotillard, in addition to Juno's Ellen Page, Batman Begins' Cillian Murphy and Oscar nominees Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) and Tom Berenger (Platoon).</desc>
