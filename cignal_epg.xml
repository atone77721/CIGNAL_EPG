They also learn their identity is about what you love to do. So, they add onto their self-portraits and then share their drawings with each other. Cookie Monster draws his blue fur, his googly eyes, and cookies. Charlie draws her blue eyes, curly blonde hair, tap shoes, and challah bread because it’s one of her favorite Jewish foods. Julia draws her straight hair, musical notes, paw prints, and her dog Rose. Elmo draws his red fur, orange nose, a piano, and watering a flower with Abby because being a kind neighbor is part of Elmo’s identity. Tamir draws his brown skin, coily hair, comic books, and some veggies as he loves gardening in the community garden. There are so many special things that make you, you!</desc>
