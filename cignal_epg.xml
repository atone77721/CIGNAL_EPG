    <desc lang="en">Julian and the kids at Greendale School are excited about a Festival of flight - Ted's coming to talk about aviation and Alf's bringing Cedric the racing pigeon. Pat has to deliver special jet boots to the school, built by Ted's inventor friend. Ted will demonstrate them. But on the way to Greendale, Pat stops to help Alf, whose cows have got loose. Pat sees Ajay, out for a day's bird-watching. Pat has promised to lend Ajay his wellies and asks Ajay to get them from the van, but Ajay takes the jet boots by mistake. By the time Pat realises the mixup, Ajay is airborne and can't control the powerful boots... Meanwhile Alf and Ted grow competitive as they try to win the kids' attention. Attempts to shout instructions to Ajay fail, but Pat realises Cedric could be the solution. The brave bird takes an instruction leaflet up to Ajay - who is then able to control the boots (using his toes) with ease! Meera, Julian and the others are delighted as Ajay touches down at Greendale School with the help of Cedric - the most welcome bird Ajay has ever watched!</desc>

Pat has to deliver special jet boots to the school, built by Ted's inventor friend. Ted will demonstrate them. But on the way to Greendale, Pat stops to help Alf, whose cows have got loose. Pat sees Ajay, out for a day's bird-watching. Pat has promised to lend Ajay his wellies and asks Ajay to get them from the van, but Ajay takes the jet boots by mistake. By the time Pat realises the mixup, Ajay is airborne and can't control the powerful boots... Meanwhile Alf and Ted grow competitive as they try to win the kids' attention. Attempts to shout instructions to Ajay fail, but Pat realises Cedric could be the solution. The brave bird takes an instruction leaflet up to Ajay - who is then able to control the boots (using his toes) with ease!
