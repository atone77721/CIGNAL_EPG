Peng is skeptical at first, but after seeing the positive effects of adhering to NaiNai’s superstitions, he dives headfirst into learning all he can to secure his spot on the team. Eventually, he becomes so consumed that he “breaks up” with Yi and Jin because of their zodiac incompatibility. Cut from tryouts, Peng eventually realizes with the help of his friends that he went overboard and he has more to offer than just basketball.</desc>

Overwhelmed by her efforts to help her mom and NaiNai in the shop, Yi asks the toad to spit up helpful items – but Jin and Peng aren’t so selfless. As a result of granting an abundance of wishes for the whole crew, the toad becomes too weak to continue. Realizing the error of their ways and why the toad appeared in the first place, Yi and Everest use their magic to reverse the toad’s magic onto himself so he can wish himself home.</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Wrong Man</title>
    <desc lang="en">Academy Award winner Henry Fonda stars in director Alfred Hitchcock's real-life thriller of an innocent man trapped as the victim of a heartless criminal justice system--even though he's The Wrong Man. When an eyewitness to a robbery identifies musician Christopher Balestrero (Fonda) as the culprit, Balestrero cannot prove where he was on the day of the crime. Now, the wheels of justice--driven by the testimony of witnesses--mercilessly grind away the life of a man who looks remarkably like the real thief. Based on the novel The True Story of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero by Maxwell Anderson.</desc>
