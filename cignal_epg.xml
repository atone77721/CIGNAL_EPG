    <title lang="en">CSI S5 E15 - King Baby</title>
    <desc lang="en">Some provocative episodes from Season 5 of CSI involve Russian mail order brides ("Nesting Dolls"), infantism ("King Baby"), and the Mexican lifestyle of narcocorrido ("Snakes"). From the creative storytelling ("4x4") to the macabre ("Who Shot Sherlock?"), there’s something in Season 5 for everyone. The CSI team investigates many crimes that hit close to home as well. Grissom comes under fire from Ecklie ("Mea Culpa"), Brass tracks down his estranged daughter ("Hollywood Brass"), and during the course of the season Greg Sanders completes his transition from the lab to the field. Last, but not least, Season 5 wraps with an amazing two-part episode ("Grave Danger"), written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, where Nick comes face to face with death while the team exhausts all its resources to same him.</desc>
