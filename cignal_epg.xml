Everyone offers to help set up for the picnic but Queen Sparklewings tells them not to worry – the fairies can do it all.  Later, when Noddy and all his friends are approaching Fable Forest Station on the train they discover someone has redirected the train tracks. They can't get to Fable Forest. How will they have the picnic in time?  Noddy needs to investigate why the train tracks have been moved.  With the help of Bumpy and Revs, Noddy follows the clues and discovers that the train tracks were moved by Fairy Coco who was tired to having to do all the work for Queen Sparklewings. If no one came to the picnic at all, there'd be no tidying up to do.  Fairy Coco tells the Queen that she's very sorry for causing a mess and the Queen tells her that she's sorry too. She didn't mean to make the Fairies do all the work and miss out on the fun! Later, the picnic takes place and everyone helps clear up afterwards. It's much quicker and much more fun if everyone helps out together!  Good job Noddy!</desc>
