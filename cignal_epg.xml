Queen Sparklewings tells Noddy that the wings will only work for Fairy Coco and if anybody else tries to use them it would be dangerous as they may fall and hurt themselves.  Noddy immediately stars to investigate.  Following all the clues, he works out that Smartysaurus found the wings after Fairy Coco took them off in the Fairy Garden.  And now she's planning on flying with them! Noddy, Bumpy and Revs rush to the DinoHills to save Smartysaurus before she has a nasty accident. The big dinosaur is very excited about flying. Noddy explains that the wings will only work for Fairy Coco and Smartysaurus sadly gives them back. Clever Noddy has an idea though and later that evening, at the flying display, Smartysaurus, Toyland's first flying dinosaur makes her debut – with a little help from the building crane and a big dino-harness!  Noddy's saved the day again.  Case closed!</desc>

Pat's mission is to deliver one of Ted's inventions, a mechanical horse or “bucking bronco”, to the event. But when the bronco is accidentally switched on in the back of Pat's van, it rolls away and Pat can't find a way to recapture it. He enlists Amy's help, but jealous Pumpkin pushes the bronco away, making matters worse. Meanwhile PC Selby and Ted are each determined to be the best banjo-playing dancers Greendale (or more specifically, Dr Gilbertson) has ever seen… Pat has a great idea to catch the escaped bronco, using Dr Gilbertson's lasso-throwing skills. As Pat drives her sports car, Dr G throws the lasso - and captures the mechanical horse just in time. As she does a celebratory dance with both PC Selby and Ted, Pat is the toast of the hoe-down.
