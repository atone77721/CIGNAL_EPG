    <title lang="en">The Slave Hunters</title>
    <desc lang="en">"Slaves fervently wishing to live like a human being VS. Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!!" Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Season 4 begins with terrific back-to-back episodes involving serial killers ("Assume Nothing" / "For All Our Country"). There's a new politically minded sheriff in town and in "Invisible Evidence" he's ticked off that the CSI's can't get enough evidence to convict a rapist/murderer. Also, Nick and Sara buck for the same promotion. Along the way there are plenty of quirky cases: one involving a museum robbery ("Suckers") and one involving a dead juror ("Eleven Angry Jurors"). Grissom travels to a small town with plenty of secrets to solve a murder in "Jackpot," Catherine dates a younger man in "Early Rollout," and Sara works a case involving a woman strikingly similar to herself in "Butterflied." There's also plenty of kinkiness in "Fur and Loathing" and tragedy "Bad Words."</desc>
