Meanwhile, Pat picks up today's special delivery - blocks of ice to make an igloo at the school for their North Pole project.  Pat and Ajay struggle to get the slippery blocks into PAT2, then Pat and Jess must endure a journey with the air-con on full blast to keep the blocks frozen.  Despite this, the ice starts to melt on the way to the Schoolhouse.  PC Selby is getting concerned by the overflowing recycling and deems it a traffic hazard.  Ted and Alf help collect the recycling early but some of the plastic bottles spill onto the road, causing a road jam that blocks Pat.  By the time he gets the blocks to the schoolhouse there is nothing left but tiny ice cubes.  The children are disappointed but Pat remembers thinking the plastic bottles in the road earlier were ice.  He and Ted unload the recycling and Lauren and the children use the plastic bottles to make a much warmer igloo instead.  Mission accomplished!</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Mrs Goggins is spearheading a recycling initiative “A Greener Greendale” but has been overwhelmed by donations of plastic bottles and compost. Meanwhile, Pat picks up today's special delivery - blocks of ice to make an igloo at the school for their North Pole project.  Pat and Ajay struggle to get the slippery blocks into PAT2, then Pat and Jess must endure a journey with the air-con on full blast to keep the blocks frozen.  Despite this, the ice starts to melt on the way to the Schoolhouse.  PC Selby is getting concerned by the overflowing recycling and deems it a traffic hazard.  Ted and Alf help collect the recycling early but some of the plastic bottles spill onto the road, causing a road jam that blocks Pat.  By the time he gets the blocks to the schoolhouse there is nothing left but tiny ice cubes.  The children are disappointed but Pat remembers thinking the plastic bottles in the road earlier were ice.  He and Ted unload the recycling and Lauren and the children use the plastic bottles to make a much warmer igloo instead.  Mission accomplished!</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Slave Hunters</title>
    <desc lang="en">Slaves fervently wishing to live like a human being VS. Slave hunters chasing them tirelessly. A bloody battle between them begins to take place!!! Being a slave hunter, Daegil is disregarded by people due to his low social status. While doing his job, Daegil is offered by Lee Gyongsuk to get Song Taeha and is promised to be given a fair amount of money as a reward. Taeha was forced to become a state slave as he was wrongfully accused of stealing some provisions. After reading a secret message saying the life of Sohyeons youngest son is on the line, Taeha tries to escape in an attempt to save him, the eldest son of the Crown Prince. Daegil, however, gets wind of his plan and the two ends up fighting a bloody fight. Having barely escaped from the fierce fight, Taeha happens to accompany a woman named Hyewon. Daegil fails to track down the slave he was first assigned to capture, and constantly runs into Seolhwa who escaped from a troupe of strolling actors. To make things worse, Daegil is threatened to be killed by a group of slaves who formed a hit squad to assassinate nobles. As for Daegil, he has every reason to be successful in accomplishing his first mission. Aside from recovering his pride hurt by Taeha, Daegil needs a sizable sum of money to live a comfortable life in his old age. In the end, Taeha manages to run away from Daegil while Daegil feels affection for Hyewon.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The series enters its third season riding high as network television's top-rated drama. There is, therefore, no need for CBS to make any major cast changes, however, there are two significant additions to the cast lineup for season 3. A romantic interest is created for series regular Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle) in the form of Hank Peddigrew (Christopher Wiehl), a handsome paramedic. Also, recurring character Detective Lockwood ( Jeffrey D. Sams ) is seen on a more frequent basis. The season's most significant story development involves CSI head man Gil Grissom ( William L. Petersen ). After a few instances in which he notices that he is experiencing some hearing loss, Grissom is diagnosed with a hereditary disorder which threatens to culminate in total deafness. As the season draws to a close, Grissom undergoes surgery to correct this problem, however the results of the operation remain unclear until the beginning of season four.</desc>
