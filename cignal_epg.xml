    <desc lang="en">Everyone in Fable Fields is very worried that a new Dazzle Dragon has appeared in the land.  Big Ears says there's no such thing as a Dragon in Toyland so Noddy decides to investigate. All the evidence seems to lead to a dragon – footprints, loud noises and glimpses of shiny scales in the woods but clever Noddy thinks it through and, using his investigating skills of looking and looking again, soon realises that the ‘dragon' isn't a dragon at all! It's the knights out on patrol in their shiny armour and tight formation! Phew! Thanks Noddy!</desc>

As Pat negotiates an obstruction in the road, the van doors fly open and the rollers fly into a field of startled sheep! Integrating them into their flock, the sheep make off with them, and Pat and Jess take chase, creating more chaos on the roads. Meanwhile, PC Selby has arrived at the car wash, eager to get the panda car cleaned for his date with Dr Gilbertson. Unable to help, Ted engages him in conversation about roadblocks - and PC Selby begins erecting them all over the garage forecourt! Having finally retrieved his Special Delivery, Pat calls PC Selby, who immediately packs up his roadblocks and takes them where they're needed. After a little interruption from the cheeky sheep, the roads are safe and PC Selby escorts Pat back to the carwash. Pat and PC Selby help Ted fit his new rollers and Pat becomes his first car wash customer!</desc>
