Someone has taken their sticky anchor and without it they've no way of stopping the ship! Noddy needs to investigate before there's an accident!  He follows all the clues which leads him to the Knights. They'd been so impressed by the acrobatics of the Ninjas that they'd borrowed the sticky anchor to help them do acrobatics too!    Noddy retrieves the anchor and the Knights apologise for causing such chaos. The Pirates didn't mind though – they LOVE racing about. Thanks to Noddy, the case is closed!</desc>

Meanwhile, poor Micawber's claws are so long and he's so upset by getting them tangled up in things like Chris's scarf and the lighthouse tablecloth that he flies out of the window, carrying the tangled lighthouse keys in his claws! Chris tries to get them back and finds himself locked out of the lighthouse altogether! Luckily, Pat and Amy arrive in the SDS helicopter.  Pat lowers Amy down to Micawber who is perched on top of the lighthouse and she's soon able to clip his claws and retrieve the keys.  Phew! Well done Amy and well done Pat!</desc>
