Kayla guides them to look into the mirror and notice the beautiful things that make you, you! Everyone looks at themselves in the mirror and starts drawing what they see. They also learn their identity is about what you love to do. So, they add onto their self-portraits and then share their drawings with each other. Cookie Monster draws his blue fur, his googly eyes, and cookies. Charlie draws her blue eyes, curly blonde hair, tap shoes, and challah bread because it’s one of her favorite Jewish foods. Julia draws her straight hair, musical notes, paw prints, and her dog Rose. Elmo draws his red fur, orange nose, a piano, and watering a flower with Abby because being a kind neighbor is part of Elmo’s identity. Tamir draws his brown skin, coily hair, comic books, and some veggies as he loves gardening in the community garden. There are so many special things that make you, you!</desc>

In Billy Batson’s (Asher Angel) case, by shouting out one word—SHAZAM!—this streetwise 14-year-old foster kid can turn into the adult Super Hero Shazam (Zachary Levi), courtesy of an ancient wizard (Djimon Hounsou). Still a kid at heart—inside a ripped, godlike body—Shazam revels in this adult version of himself by doing what any teen would do with superpowers: have fun with them! Can he fly? Does he have X-ray vision? Can he shoot lightning out of his hands? Can he skip his social studies test? Shazam sets out to test the limits of his abilities with the joyful recklessness of a child. But he’ll need to master these powers quickly in order to fight the deadly forces of evil controlled by Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong).</desc>
