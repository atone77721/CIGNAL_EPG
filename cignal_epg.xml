Unbeknownst to Yi, she is taken on a realm-bending journey by NTF so that the Fox might pry away Yi’s prized violin. The crew eventually comes back together and realizes that NTF takes items people think they need to be happy. Yi was able to hold onto her violin because it truly does make her happy and is a fundamental part of who she is.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">In CLASH OF THE TITANS, the ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods. But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation, Avatar) stars as the Greek hero Perseus in this spectacular retelling of the classic myth (and '80s cult classic film). Born of a god, but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from the clutches of Hades (Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes -- Harry Potter films), the vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, he volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus (Oscar nominee Liam Neeson -- Batman Begins) and unleash hell on earth. With a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will triumph only if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.</desc>
