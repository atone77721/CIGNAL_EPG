    <title lang="en">Postman Pat: Special Delivery Service</title>
    <desc lang="en">Mrs Goggins is spearheading a recycling initiative “A Greener Greendale” but has been overwhelmed by donations of plastic bottles and compost. Meanwhile, Pat picks up today's special delivery - blocks of ice to make an igloo at the school for their North Pole project.  Pat and Ajay struggle to get the slippery blocks into PAT2, then Pat and Jess must endure a journey with the air-con on full blast to keep the blocks frozen.  Despite this, the ice starts to melt on the way to the Schoolhouse.  PC Selby is getting concerned by the overflowing recycling and deems it a traffic hazard.  Ted and Alf help collect the recycling early but some of the plastic bottles spill onto the road, causing a road jam that blocks Pat.  By the time he gets the blocks to the schoolhouse there is nothing left but tiny ice cubes.  The children are disappointed but Pat remembers thinking the plastic bottles in the road earlier were ice.  He and Ted unload the recycling and Lauren and the children use the plastic bottles to make a much warmer igloo instead.  Mission accomplished!</desc>

Pat and Ajay struggle to get the slippery blocks into PAT2, then Pat and Jess must endure a journey with the air-con on full blast to keep the blocks frozen.  Despite this, the ice starts to melt on the way to the Schoolhouse.  PC Selby is getting concerned by the overflowing recycling and deems it a traffic hazard.  Ted and Alf help collect the recycling early but some of the plastic bottles spill onto the road, causing a road jam that blocks Pat.  By the time he gets the blocks to the schoolhouse there is nothing left but tiny ice cubes.  The children are disappointed but Pat remembers thinking the plastic bottles in the road earlier were ice.  He and Ted unload the recycling and Lauren and the children use the plastic bottles to make a much warmer igloo instead.  Mission accomplished!</desc>
