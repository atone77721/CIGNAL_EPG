Together, they realize that their connections to one another are the most powerful magic of all.</desc>

Attempts to shout instructions to Ajay fail, but Pat realises Cedric could be the solution. The brave bird takes an instruction leaflet up to Ajay - who is then able to control the boots (using his toes) with ease!
