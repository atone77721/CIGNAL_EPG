They also learn their identity is about what you love to do. So, they add onto their self-portraits and then share their drawings with each other. Cookie Monster draws his blue fur, his googly eyes, and cookies. Charlie draws her blue eyes, curly blonde hair, tap shoes, and challah bread because it’s one of her favorite Jewish foods. Julia draws her straight hair, musical notes, paw prints, and her dog Rose. Elmo draws his red fur, orange nose, a piano, and watering a flower with Abby because being a kind neighbor is part of Elmo’s identity. Tamir draws his brown skin, coily hair, comic books, and some veggies as he loves gardening in the community garden. There are so many special things that make you, you!</desc>

    <desc lang="en">A wish-granting toad drops into Yi and the crew’s life just as the dumpling shop is being reviewed by a food magazine writer. Overwhelmed by her efforts to help her mom and NaiNai in the shop, Yi asks the toad to spit up helpful items – but Jin and Peng aren’t so selfless. As a result of granting an abundance of wishes for the whole crew, the toad becomes too weak to continue. Realizing the error of their ways and why the toad appeared in the first place, Yi and Everest use their magic to reverse the toad’s magic onto himself so he can wish himself home.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Season 4 begins with terrific back-to-back episodes involving serial killers ("Assume Nothing" / "For All Our Country"). There's a new politically minded sheriff in town and in "Invisible Evidence" he's ticked off that the CSI's can't get enough evidence to convict a rapist/murderer. Also, Nick and Sara buck for the same promotion. Along the way there are plenty of quirky cases: one involving a museum robbery ("Suckers") and one involving a dead juror ("Eleven Angry Jurors"). Grissom travels to a small town with plenty of secrets to solve a murder in "Jackpot," Catherine dates a younger man in "Early Rollout," and Sara works a case involving a woman strikingly similar to herself in "Butterflied." There's also plenty of kinkiness in "Fur and Loathing" and tragedy "Bad Words."</desc>

Sam Worthington (Terminator Salvation, Avatar) stars as the Greek hero Perseus in this spectacular retelling of the classic myth (and '80s cult classic film). Born of a god, but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from the clutches of Hades (Oscar nominee Ralph Fiennes -- Harry Potter films), the vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, he volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus (Oscar nominee Liam Neeson -- Batman Begins) and unleash hell on earth. With a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will triumph only if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.</desc>
