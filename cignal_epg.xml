    <desc lang="en">The children are excited as there's a big Winter Snowdown on the fells. There's a snowman building competition, followed by a race down the snowy hill! Pat's Special Delivery is a consignment of deflated inner tubes for them to slide on, but the 4x4 hits an icy patch and slips into a ditch - and when Ted tries to rescue him, his truck gets stuck as well! On the fells competition is rife - not between the children, but with Ajay and Amy! Everyone is keen for the race to begin - but where is Pat with the inner tubes? Thanks to some cheeky sheep playing ‘follow the leader' with Jess, Pat has an idea. He and Ted pump up two of the inner tubes and Jess and the sheep pull them like huskies to the fells with the rest of the Special Delivery! Pat zooms in and saves the day - and everyone enjoys the race, including two very cheeky sheep!</desc>
