Despite warnings from all the animals Porcupine allows Jackal to invite her to his cave to keep out of the rain. Porcupine takes off her coat to allow it to dry, but while she sleeps naughty Jackal runs off with it. When she awakes Porcupine is covered in lots of tiny ant bites and they itch and they itch and they itch. Tortoise suggests Elephant squeeze some milk from the Milky Quill bush… but Porcupine can't wait anymore and runs into the Quill bushes to relieve her itching. Crash! Crash! Crash! Porcupine crashes through the Quill bushes and emerges covered in spikey quills! The animals can't believe their eyes!

In Billy Batson’s (Asher Angel) case, by shouting out one word—SHAZAM!—this streetwise 14-year-old foster kid can turn into the adult Super Hero Shazam (Zachary Levi), courtesy of an ancient wizard (Djimon Hounsou). Still a kid at heart—inside a ripped, godlike body—Shazam revels in this adult version of himself by doing what any teen would do with superpowers: have fun with them! Can he fly? Does he have X-ray vision? Can he shoot lightning out of his hands? Can he skip his social studies test? Shazam sets out to test the limits of his abilities with the joyful recklessness of a child. But he’ll need to master these powers quickly in order to fight the deadly forces of evil controlled by Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong).</desc>
