    <desc lang="en">Academy Award winner Henry Fonda stars in director Alfred Hitchcock's real-life thriller of an innocent man trapped as the victim of a heartless criminal justice system--even though he's The Wrong Man. When an eyewitness to a robbery identifies musician Christopher Balestrero (Fonda) as the culprit, Balestrero cannot prove where he was on the day of the crime. Now, the wheels of justice--driven by the testimony of witnesses--mercilessly grind away the life of a man who looks remarkably like the real thief. Based on the novel The True Story of Christopher Emmanuel Balestrero by Maxwell Anderson.</desc>
